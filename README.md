The goal is to redirect directly by using the "Refresh" header, you need to set the header BEFORE sending the response.<br>URI Example: http://localhost:3000/?method=%m%<br><br>%m% have to be replaced with a "method"

## Methods

- render
- nothing1
- nothing2

Why i updated `X-Powered-By` value ?<br>=> It's a way to know that you use an Express server the exact value is `Experss` a few other way exist too :)
